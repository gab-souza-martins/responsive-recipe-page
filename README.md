## My process

### What I'm proud of
I am proud to have learned how to make a responsive design. When I was learning HTML and CSS, I was more focused on the syntax and how to write clean code, but understanding how important it is for the design to work well in multiple devices will be of extreme importance in my future career.

### What I would do differently
For this project, I designed the desktop design first and then the mobile, since I am working on a computer. Next time, however, I would like to go for a mobile-first approach, since that is a much larger part of the market.

### What challenges I faced
As previously said, I hadn't learned much about responsive design until this project, so that was a challenge. I managed to overcome it by looking for the basics of media queries, as well as utilizing max-width and min-width to reduce what would need to be resolved through queries.

The image was also another challenge. I am still not used to how images behave in CSS, so trying to figure out how to make the width and margin work like how I wanted was difficult.
